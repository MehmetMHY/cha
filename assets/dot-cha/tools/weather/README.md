# Cha Weather Tool

This is a weather information tool for [Cha](https://github.com/MehmetMHY/cha/) that retrieves and displays the userâ€™s current weather stats using [wttr.in](https://wttr.in/).

## Features

- Fetches up-to-date weather stats in JSON from wttr.in
- Answers user questions about the weather using Cha's tool interface
- Can be called with the alias `!weather`
- User input (question) and most recent chat history are piped into the tool for contextual answers

## Usage

### Within Cha

Integrate this tool into your `.cha/tools/weather/` directory.  
You can invoke the tool in Cha chat using the alias:

```
!weather <your weather question>
```

**Example:**

```
!weather will it be sunny today?
```

The tool will fetch current weather data and answer your question accordingly, taking into account your question and up to two of your most recent chat messages.

### As Standalone

Run the script directly from the terminal:

```shell
python main.py
```

Follow the prompt to enter your weather-related query, starting with `!weather`, for example:

```
!weather Is it raining right now?
```

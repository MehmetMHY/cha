# Cha - Docker

## Overview

Run Cha using Docker to access the CLI tool via your browser. This is useful if you prefer not to install all dependencies or are using Windows.

## How To Run (Easily Steps)

1. Make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed

2. Run the main run script:

   ```bash
   bash run.sh
   ```

3. (NOTE) If this does not work, follow the steps below...

## Setup Instructions (MacOS & Linux)

1. Make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed

2. Configure your **.env** file with the necessary API keys. See Cha's main README for details on required keys.

3. Load your **.env** file:

   ```bash
   # If the file is in the current directory
   source ./.env

   # If the file is in the root Cha directory
   source ../.env
   ```

4. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t gotty-term .
   ```

5. Run the Docker image as a container:

   ```bash
   docker run -it -p 8080:8080 \
       -e OPENAI_API_KEY \
       gotty-term
   ```

6. Open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

7. Once opened, you should see a bash terminal. Run Cha from there:

   ```bash
   cha
   ```

## Setup Instructions (Windows)

1. Make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed

2. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t gotty-term .
   ```

3. Run the Docker image as a container:

   - This is NOT secure but this is the easiest way to run this in Windows; ya Windows should have been Unix based lol

   ```bash
   # NOTE: enter your environment variables here!
   docker run -it -p 8080:8080 `
       -e "OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>" `
       gotty-term
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

5. Once opened, you should see a bash terminal. Run Cha from there:

   ```bash
   cha
   ```

## How To Set Up?

### 1. Install cha

Clone this repo, cd into it's directory, and run the following command to install or upgrade `cha`:

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade .
```

### 2. Configure API Key

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory.

2. Get your OpenAI API key [HERE](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

3. Add your keys to the `.env` file, following this format:

   - You can get your OpenAI API key [HERE](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - If you want to use Answer-Search, you need to grab a Brave API key which you can [HERE](https://brave.com/search/api/)

```env
# Replace YOUR_KEY_HERE with your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"

# (optional) replace YOUR_KEY_HERE with your Brave API key for Answer-Search
export BRAVE_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
```

4. Activate the environment variables:

```bash
source .env
```

### 3. Run cha

Execute the main script by running:

```bash
cha
```

### 4. Optional, setup an alias/command for cha

To simplify the use of `cha`, you can create a useful alias/command. Either create your own or add the alias/command I use for Cha. To do this, run the following command (only run one of these commands for your respective shell):

```bash
# if you are using a zsh shell
cat cha.sh >> $HOME/.zshrc

# if you are using a sh or bash shell
cat cha.sh >> $HOME/.bashrc
```

Now you should be all set!
